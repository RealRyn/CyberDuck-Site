# CyberDuck-Site
I made an site for high school HTML final project, I aimed for an Cyberpunk/Futuristic theme. the content itself is mostly random bullshit, but the functionality actually work!


- SQL is REALLY messy. Don't even try to mess with it.
- There are a bunch of (console.log..) around the application, those are just debuggers for me.
- Some notes are in the HTML itself, so beware.
- I created this site as part of a Final High School project (10th grade), and it is super inefficient and slow...

Please don't copy my work! use it only as a base for learning.
